## Code like Salvatore Sanfilippo / antirez (@antirez) · comments that earn their keep

Readable C, of all things — because the comments do real work. ASCII-art diagrams of the data structure sit above the code that implements it. Every function comment states the contract, the error return, and the ownership of any pointer it touches. When something is non-obvious — memory layouts, algorithmic cases, pointer arithmetic — the comment draws it out step by step. Nothing obvious gets a comment; nothing non-obvious goes unexplained.

### `rax.h` — the whole data structure drawn in ASCII before a line of it is implemented
[source](https://github.com/antirez/rax/blob/1927550cb218ec3c3dda8b39d82d1d019bf0476d/rax.h)
```c
/* Representation of a radix tree as implemented in this file, that contains
 * the strings "foo", "foobar" and "footer" after the insertion of each
 * word. When the node represents a key inside the radix tree, we write it
 * between [], otherwise it is written between ().
 *
 * This is the vanilla representation:
 *
 *              (f) ""
 *                \
 *                (o) "f"
 *                  \
 *                  (o) "fo"
 *                    \
 *                  [t   b] "foo"
 *                  /     \
 *         "foot" (e)     (a) "foob"
 *                /         \
 *      "foote" (r)         (r) "fooba"
 *              /             \
 *    "footer" []             [] "foobar"
 *
 * However, this implementation implements a very common optimization where
 * successive nodes having a single child are "compressed" into the node
 * itself as a string of characters, each representing a next-level child,
 * and only the link to the node representing the last character node is
 * provided inside the representation. So the above representation is turned
 * into:
 *
 *                  ["foo"] ""
 *                     |
 *                  [t   b] "foo"
 *                  /     \
 *        "foot" ("er")    ("ar") "foob"
 *                 /          \
 *       "footer" []          [] "foobar"
 *
 * However this optimization makes the implementation a bit more complex.
 * For instance if a key "first" is added in the above radix tree, a
 * "node splitting" operation is needed, since the "foo" prefix is no longer
 * composed of nodes having a single child one after the other. This is the
 * above tree and the resulting node splitting after this event happens:
 *
 *
 *                    (f) ""
 *                    /
 *                 (i o) "f"
 *                 /   \
 *    "firs"  ("rst")  (o) "fo"
 *              /        \
 *    "first" []       [t   b] "foo"
 *                     /     \
 *           "foot" ("er")    ("ar") "foob"
 *                    /          \
 *          "footer" []          [] "foobar"
 *
 * Similarly after deletion, if a new chain of nodes having a single child
 * is created (the chain must also not include nodes that represent keys),
 * it must be compressed back into a single node.
 *

```
The reader understands three variants of the data structure — vanilla, compressed, after split — before seeing a single typedef. This is not decoration; it is the spec. The code that follows is a direct translation of what the diagram commits to.

### `rax.h` — the node struct with its memory layout diagram inline
[source](https://github.com/antirez/rax/blob/1927550cb218ec3c3dda8b39d82d1d019bf0476d/rax.h)
```c
#define RAX_NODE_MAX_SIZE ((1<<29)-1)
typedef struct raxNode {
    uint32_t iskey:1;     /* Does this node contain a key? */
    uint32_t isnull:1;    /* Associated value is NULL (don't store it). */
    uint32_t iscompr:1;   /* Node is compressed. */
    uint32_t size:29;     /* Number of children, or compressed string len. */
    /* Data layout is as follows:
     *
     * If node is not compressed we have 'size' bytes, one for each children
     * character, and 'size' raxNode pointers, point to each child node.
     * Note how the character is not stored in the children but in the
     * edge of the parents:
     *
     * [header iscompr=0][abc][a-ptr][b-ptr][c-ptr](value-ptr?)
     *
     * if node is compressed (iscompr bit is 1) the node has 1 children.
     * In that case the 'size' bytes of the string stored immediately at
     * the start of the data section, represent a sequence of successive
     * nodes linked one after the other, for which only the last one in
     * the sequence is actually represented as a node, and pointed to by
     * the current compressed node.
     *
     * [header iscompr=1][xyz][z-ptr](value-ptr?)
     *
     * Both compressed and not compressed nodes can represent a key
     * with associated data in the radix tree at any level (not just terminal
     * nodes).
     *
     * If the node has an associated key (iskey=1) and is not NULL
     * (isnull=0), then after the raxNode pointers poiting to the
     * children, an additional value pointer is present (as you can see
     * in the representation above as "value-ptr" field).
     */
    unsigned char data[];
} raxNode;
```
The struct comment is not a summary of the fields — it shows the exact byte layout for both compressed and uncompressed cases, including the optional trailing `value-ptr`. Every `raxNodeCurrentLength` macro and every `memmove` in the implementation becomes legible because this comment told you what the bytes look like.

### `rax.c` — `raxAddChild`: each memmove traced through an ASCII before/after

     * child, plus the padding needed in order to store addresses into aligned
     * locations.

Each `memmove` is prefaced with an ASCII snapshot of the buffer before and after, so the reader can verify that the pointer arithmetic is correct without executing it mentally. This is what it looks like when comments pull their weight on inherently hard code — not paraphrasing the code, but showing the state change the code produces.
